    <h3><p align="center">This section introduces you to the National Identity Elements of India. These symbols are intrinsic to the Indian identity and heritage. 
        Indians of all demographics backgrounds across the world are proud of these National Symbols as they infuse a sense of 
        pride and patriotism in every Indian's heart.National symbols intend to unite people by creating visual, verbal, or iconic 
        representations of the national people, values, goals, or history. These symbols are often rallied around as part of

    <h2 id="nationalflag">National Flag</h2>
    <img src="./national_flag.jpg" alt="" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p><b>The National Flag</b> is a horizontal tricolour of India saffron (kesaria) at the top, white in the middle and India green at 
        the bottom in equal proportion. The ratio of width of the flag to its length is two to three. In the centre of the white 
        band is a navy-blue wheel which represents the chakra.
        The top saffron colour, indicates the strength and courage of the country. The white middle band indicates peace and truth 
        with Dharma Chakra. The green shows the fertility, growth and auspiciousness of the land.
        Its design is that of the wheel which appears on the abacus of the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka. 
        Its diameter approximates to the width of the white band and it has 24 spokes. The design of the National Flag was adopted 
        by the Constituent Assembly of India on 22 July 1947.</p>

    <h2 id="nationalbird">National Bird</h2>
    <img src="./national_bird.jpg" alt="Peacok" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p><b>The Indian peacock</b>, Pavo cristatus, the National Bird of India, is a colourful, swan-sized bird, with a fan-shaped 
        crest of feathers, a white patch under the eye and a long, slender neck. The male of the species is more colourful 
        than the female, with a glistening blue breast and neck and a spectacular bronze-green tail of around 200 elongated feathers. 
        The female is brownish, slightly smaller than the male and lacks the tail. The elaborate courtship dance of the male, 
        fanning out the tail and preening its feathers is a gorgeous sight.</p>

    <h2 id="nationalanimal">National Animal</h2>
    <img src="./natinal_animal.jpg" alt="Tiger" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p>The <b>Tiger</b> (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable 
        for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, 
        such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous 
        areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for 
        about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.
        The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758. It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to 
        the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. 
        Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated 
        from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. 
        What remains of the range where tigers still roam free is fragmented, stretching in spots from Siberian temperate forests 
        to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single Indonesian island, Sumatra.</p>

    <h2 id="nationalflower">National Flower</h2>
    <img src="./national_flower.jpg" alt="Lotus" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p><b>Lotus (Nelumbo Nucifera Gaertn)</b> is the National Flower of India. It is a sacred flower and occupies a unique position 
        in the art and mythology of ancient India and has been an auspicious symbol of Indian culture since time immemorial.
        India is rich in flora. Currently available data place India in the tenth position in the world and fourth in Asia in plant 
        diversity. From about 70 per cent geographical area surveyed so far, 47,000 species of plants have been described by the 
        Botanical Survey of India (BSI).
        Lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas. Stands of lotus drop hundreds 
        of thousands of seeds every year to the bottom of the pond. While some sprout immediately, and most are eaten by wildlife, 
        the remaining seeds can remain dormant for an extensive period of time as the pond silts in and dries out. During flood 
        conditions, sediments containing these seeds are broken open, and the dormant seeds rehydrate and begin a new lotus colony.
        Under favorable circumstances, the seeds of this aquatic perennial may remain viable for many years, with the oldest recorded 
        lotus germination being from seeds 1,300 years old recovered from a dry lakebed in northeastern China.[3] Therefore, 
        the Chinese regard the plant as a symbol of longevity.</p>

    <h2 id="nationalanthem">National Anthem</h2>
    <img src="./jana gana mana.jfif"alt="Jana Gana Mana" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p>The National Anthem of India <b>Jana-gana-mana</b>, composed originally in Bengali by Rabindranath Tagore, was adopted in its 
        Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly as the National Anthem of India on 24 January 1950. It was first sung on 27 
        December 1911 at the Kolkata Session of the Indian National Congress.
        The complete song consists of five stanzas. The first stanza contains the full version of the National Anthem.
        Playing time of the full version of the national anthem is approximately 52 seconds. A short version consisting of the first 
        and last lines of the stanza (playing time approximately 20 seconds) is also played on certain occasions.

    <h2 id="nationalsong">National Song</h2>
    <img src="./vande mataram.jfif" alt="Natinal Song">
    <p>
        The song <b>Vande Mataram</b>, composed in Sanskrit by Bankimchandra Chatterji, was a source of inspiration to the people in their struggle for freedom. 
        It has an equal status with Jana-gana-mana. On January 24, 1950, the President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad came up with a statement in 
        the Constituent Assembly, "the song Vande Mataram, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be 
        honoured equally with Jana Gana Mana and shall have equal status with it."
        The first political occasion when it was sung was the 1896 session of the Indian National Congress. The song was a part of 
        Bankimchandra's most famous novel Anand Math (1882).
        It played a vital role in the Indian independence movement, first sung in a political context by Rabindranath Tagore at the 
        1896 session of the Indian National Congress.[17] It became a popular marching song for political activism and Indian freedom 
        movement in 1905.[5] Spiritual Indian nationalist and philosopher Sri Aurobindo referred it as "National Anthem of Bengal".
        The song and the novel containing it was banned by the colonial government, but workers and the general public defied the ban 
        (with many being imprisoned repeatedly for singing it in public); with the ban being overturned by the Indian government after 
        the country gained independence from colonial rule in 1947.

    <h2 id="nationalpledge">National Pledge</h2>
    <img src="./National_Pledge_of_India.png" alt="National Pledge" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p><b>The Indian National Pledge</b> was composed by Pydimarri Venkata Subba Rao. Subbarao, a noted author in Telugu and a bureaucrat, 
        composed the pledge while serving as the District Treasury Officer of Visakhapatnam District in 1962. He presented it to the 
        senior Congress leader Tenneti Viswanadham who forwarded it to the then Education Minister P.V.G. Raju. Subba Rao was born 
        in Anneparti, Nalgonda District, Telangana. He was an expert in Telugu, Sanskrit, Hindi, English and Arabic languages. 
        He worked as Treasury officer in the state of Hyderabad. After the formation of Andhra Pradesh, he worked in Khammam, 
        Nizamabad, Nellore, Visakhapatnam and Nalgonda Districts.[3] The pledge was introduced in many schools in 1963
        The Indian National Pledge is commonly recited by Indians at public events, during daily assemblies in many Indian schools, 
        and during the Independence Day and Republic Day commemoration ceremonies. Unlike the National Anthem or the National Song, 
        whose authors are well known in India, P.V. Subba Rao, the author of the pledge remains largely a little-known figure, his 
        name being mentioned neither in the books nor in any documents. Records with the Human Resources Development Ministry of the
        Government of India however record Subbarao as the author of the pledge. Subba Rao himself is thought to have been unaware of 
        its status as the National Pledge with a position on par with the National Anthem and the National Song. Apparently, he learned 
        of this when his granddaughter was reading the pledge from her textbook</p>

    <h2 id="nationalcurrency">National Currency</h2>
    <img src="./Indian_Rupee.png" alt="Indian Rupee" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p><b>The Indian rupee</b> (symbol: ₹; code: INR) is the official currency of India. The rupee is subdivided into 100 paise 
        (singular: paisa), though as of 2019, coins of denomination of 1 rupee is the lowest value in use. The issuance of the 
        currency is controlled by the Reserve Bank of India. The Reserve Bank manages currency in India and derives its role in 
        currency management on the basis of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.
        In 2010, a new rupee sign (₹) was officially adopted. It was derived from the combination of the Devanagari consonant "र" (ra) 
        and the Latin capital letter "R" without its vertical bar. The parallel lines at the top (with white space between them) are 
        said to make an allusion to the tricolour Indian flag,[9] and also depict an equality sign that symbolises the nation's desire 
        to reduce economic disparity. The first series of coins with the new rupee sign started in circulation on 8 July 2011. Before
         this, India used "₨" and "Re" as the symbols for multiple rupees and one rupee, respectively.
